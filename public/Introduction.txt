I am Elwin! 😎 Nice to meet you! I am a Computer Science 💻 Student from the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang. I have interest in the data science and software development and been exploring new technologies in the tech industry. At leisure, I love to make latte arts ☕️ and I worked as a part-time barista before in a local café. Other than that, hiking 🏔️ is my favourite extreme sport and I always seek for hills and mountains to hike during my weekend. I also play badminton 🏸 occasionally with my friends and colleagues (if there is 😆). If I am appealing to you, let’s meet up and connect with each other!
